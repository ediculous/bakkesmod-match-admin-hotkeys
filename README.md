### Description:

This is a Bakkesmod plugin that allows you to change the score, pause/unpause the match, and reset to kickoff using bindable hotkeys.

I intend on adding the ability to change the game time as well, but that will be for a future update.

_Note that this only works in LAN matches. If I can find a way to get it to function in private online matches, I'll update this._

#### 1.0.0 features:
* Configurable keybinds that allow you to:
   * Control the score for each team
   * Pause/Unpause the match
   * Reset to kickoff

#### Default keybinds
- Blue +1: `U`
- Blue −1: `J`
- Orange +1: `I`
- Orange −1: `K`
- Pause/Unpause: `P`
- Reset to Kickoff: `O`

You can change these from **F2 → Plugins → MatchAdminHotkeys → Settings**, then **Save Keybinds**.
